## Overview of Git

Git is the revision control system behind GitHub. Git's role is to help making
code development more organized and to facilitate collaboration.

## Graphical Interface vs Command Line

- We will use the command line to understand the process
- This will help you understand the processes better
- You can use a Graphical Interface in the future

## Using Linux from Terminal.com

In order to try git, we will be using virtual Linux machines available online.
To get started, head to [Terminal.com](www.terminal.com) and create an account.
From there, we will be using an already available machine (or Snap). We will use
[this one](https://www.terminal.com/snapshot/987f8d702dc0a6e8158b48ccd3dec24f819a7ccb2756c396ef1fd7f5b34b7980). Leave the default settings as they are but click the two
following boxes, found near the bottom of the grey box on the right:

- Start as Temporary Terminal
- Auto-pause

This will ensure you never have to pay for your machine. It also means that
after an hour, the virtual machine will destroy itself. This is not a problem
for our workshop since we can then simply start another one.

Once the virtual machine is started, your screen will be divided in sections.
The only ones we want to use are `Terminal`, `Files`, and `Editor`, so you can
click on the other ones (`Browser` and `Chat`) to remove them. If you click on
the arrows after the name, the selected section will take the whole screen.

## Installing Git

Installing git on the Linux virtual machine is simple. Type the following code
in the terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

## Git setup

We now need to setup our Linux terminal to integrate well with GitHub. We
follow the official [GitHub setup help page](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
for this.

## Next section
In the next section, we will explore the standard Git workflow with some
exercices. We will create and modify a repository and learn the ropes of Git.
