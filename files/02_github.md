## A graphical overview of GitHub
In this section, we look at the different parts of GitHub and at a user
account.

### Main Page
When you do not have an account the GitHub main page offers you to search among
the existing projects or to create an account. <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Main page</a> [Main page](https://github.com)

### User Page
The user pages show an avatar of the users and list their projects. Only the
most popular projects are listed but by clicking on the `repository` tab, you
can access all of a user's projects. [User page](https://github.com/enormandeau)

### Projects (or repositories)
In Git parlance, projects are called repositories. Repositories contain folders
and files, as well as all the history information about the project, like the
changes that were applied, when, by whom, and all the versions all the files
that have existed throughout the project's existence.

### Example Project
Let's look at an example project: [Example
project](https://github.com/enormandeau/meditation-timer). This project
contains a `data` folder, some files, including a script, a licence and a
`README.md` file. This last file is used by GitHub to create the rest of the
page that describes the project. It is very useful to have such a `README.md`
file and to use it to describe the project, as well as how to install or use
the scripts.

## Creating an account
We will now create a new GitHub account from which to work. Please choose and
fill the following sections:

- Login name
- Email address
- Password

Then choose the `Free` plan and click on `Finish sign up`. Congratulations, you
now have a GitHub account. You will need to verify your email account before
you can use it, so please do so now.

## Creating a test project
Once you have validated your account, creating a new project is easy: 

- Click on the `+` sign in the upper right and select `New repository`
- Name your repository `test`
- Add a short description if desired
- Click on `Initialize this repository with a README`
- Click on the green `Create repository` button

Your empty directory has been created. You can now modify it, either directly
from GitHub in your browser or on your computer.

## Editing the README file from GitHub
To modify the `README.md` file directly from GitHub:

- Click on the `README.md` link
- Click on the pen in the upper right portion of the file
- Copy the following text to the `README.md` file:

```
## This is a level 2 title

- This
- is
- a
- list

### This is a level 3 title

Here is a command: `echo "Hello!"`
```

  - Click on the `Commit changes` button on the bottom
  - Your changes are now effective and visible!

## Forking a project
In order to test how Git works, we will use a training project containing a bit
of data and some basic R code to produce figures. You do not need to know how
to program in R to follow this example. We will introduce the changes to the
code together. To get the repository:

- Got to [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/enormandeau/github_repository)
- Click on the `Fork` button near the upper right of the screen

This will create a personal copy of the repository for you to work with.

## Next section
In the next section, we will set up a Terminal.com account from which we will
install Git and set it to work with your GitHub account.
