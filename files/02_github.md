## Creating an account
We will now create a new GitHub account from which to work.

  - Login name
  - Email address
  - Password
  - Choosing free plan

## Creating a test project
  - Click on the `+` sign in the upper right and select `New repository`
  - Name your repository `test`
  - Click on `Initialize this repository with a README`
  - Click on the green `Create repository` button

## Editing the README file from GitHub
  - Click on the `README.md` link
  - Click on the pen in the upper right portion of the file
  - Add the following text to the `README.md` file:

```
## This is a level 2 title

- This
- is
- a
- list

### This is a level 3 title

Here is a command: `echo "Hello!"`

Here is a longer piece of code:

```bash
for i in Git is fun!
do
    echo $i
done
```

  - Click on the `Commit changes` button on the bottom
  - Your changes are now effective!

## Forking a project
In order to test how Git works, we will use a fake project containing a bit of
data and some basic R code to produce figures. You do not need to know how to
program in R to follow this example. We will introduce the changes to the code
together.

## Next section
In the next section, we will set up Git to work with your GitHub account.
