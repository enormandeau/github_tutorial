# Conclusion

This concludes our brief introduction of Git and GitHub for scientists. You
should now know the basics of how to setup and use both Git and GitHub for
small programming projects.

You can now start using Git and GitHub to create, structure, and share your
projects, as well as collaborate on them. Git is very useful but there are ways
in which you could mess-up a project. As you start using Git, it is probably
wise to also keep backups of your project folder in case you break something.
Later, you won't need these backups anymore.

This tutorial didn't cover more advanced material. Interested users should
