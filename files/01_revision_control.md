## What it is
In a few words, revision control is the **management of changes to documents**.
As programming and research projects get larger, it is useful or even essential
to be able to keep track of changes and be able to revert to earlier versions
when needed.

## How it can help you
A revision control system, like Git, tracks changes made to files over time and
**keeps a copy of older versions**. It also works as a log of progress by
storing messages that describe these changes. This process helps you **organize
your analysis code into a working state**. When used in combination with
GitHub, a Git project hosting service, **your project can easily be shared with
others**, making your research more reproducible. Finally, it also greatly
**facilitates collaboration**. Even if you are the only contributor to your
project, hosting it online **increases your visibility**, which is good for
your career!

## Why chose Git and GitHub?
There are many revision systems and online code hosting services. However, Git
and GitHub are by far the most used by scientists. This means there are tons of
online ressources about how to get started and using Git and GitHub, so getting
help is easy.

In the next section, we will discover GitHub, including how to create an
account and start a new project, also know as a repository.
