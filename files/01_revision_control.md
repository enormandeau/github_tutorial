## What it is

## How it works

## How it can help you
Taking the time to carefully document your progress helps you stay organized, and provides a time-stamped (and commit-messaged) record of your best workflows in your analysis. This carefully crafted workflow is automatically shared with others who can assist you in making the best of your project (and to sometimes save you from making mistakes!).  


## Why chose Git and Github?
Github is a easy step into the world of revision control, with many online resources that provide excellent advice on how to best use the tool. Many software developers are moving their projects to Github to help their users to see exactly what is changing between versions, and to facilitate collaboration.
