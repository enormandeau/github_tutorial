## What is revision control?

In a few words, revision control is the **management of changes to documents**.
As programming and research projects get larger, it is useful, or even
essential, to be able to keep track of changes and be able to revert to earlier
versions when needed.

## How can revision control help you?

A revision control system, like Git:

- Tracks changes made to text files over time
- Keeps a "copy" of all older versions
- Works as a log of progress by storing messages that describe changes
- Helps you organize your analysis code into a working state
- Helps you share your project with others
- Makes your research more reproducible
- Greatly facilitates collaboration
- Increases your visibility, which is good for your career!

## Why chose Git and GitHub?

and GitHub are the most used by scientists. This means there are tons of
