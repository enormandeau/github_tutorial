## What is revision control?

In a few words, revision control is the **management of changes to documents**.
As programming and research projects get larger, it is useful, or even
essential, to be able to keep track of changes and be able to revert to earlier
versions when needed.

## How can revision control help you?

A revision control system, like Git:

- Tracks changes made to files over time
- Keeps a copy of all older versions
- Works as a log of progress by storing messages that describe changes
- Helps you organize your analysis code into a working state
- Help you share your project with others
- Makes your research more reproducible
- Greatly facilitates collaboration
- Increases your visibility, which is good for your career!

## Why chose Git and GitHub?

There are many revision systems and online code hosting services. However, Git
and GitHub are by far the most used by scientists. This means there are tons of
online resources on how to get started using Git and GitHub, and so getting
help is easy!
