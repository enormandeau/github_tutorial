# Basic Workflow

## Creating a new project

- Create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Include a README file (actually, it will be a README.md file)
  
## Downloading a repository from GitHub

- Clicking the `Download ZIP` link
- Copy the clone URL on the main page of the repository, and use `git clone
  <URL>` in
  the terminal
  
## Git basic workflow

- Making some changes (adding and editing files)
- See what files have changed: `git status`
- Visualize the changes: `git diff`
- Choose files to commit `git add`
- Commit changes `git commit -m "Message"`
- Send commit to GitHub `git push`
- View log of commits with messages `git log`
  
## Using markdown in your README.md

Any `markdown` formatting you put in your README.md file will be rendered
nicely on your repository page. For example, this whole course has been created
as a repository of files containing `markdown` formatting.

Here are some basic effects:

- Use one `-` at the beginning of 2+ lines to create a list of items (like this one)
- Use `*word*` to create *italic*
- Use `**word**` to add **bold**
- Use `\`code\`` to write inline code
- Use `\`\`\`lines of code\`\`\`` to write code on multiple lines
- Use `#` `##` `###` for level 1, 2, and 3 titles
- Use `[Text](link)` to insert html links
- Use `![Text](image-location)` to insert images
