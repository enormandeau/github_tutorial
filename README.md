## An introduction to Git and GitHub

This tutorial covers the basics of the Git version control tool in combination
with the popular GitHub web platform. It should be useful to anyone wanting to
learn about Git and GitHub but is specifically designed for students and academics
who program during their projects and want to learn more about
social coding.

## Why learn Git and GitHub?

By doing so, you will improve your ability to:

- Increase your online presence

- Use best practices for coding and analysis
- Structure your code and projects
- Create basic web pages to show your analyses
- Create easy documentation and tutorials
- Show that your projects are alive
- Track code changes and version features

Git and GitHub can help you accomplish the above. However, **these methods require some
work** to get you started, but **it can also be fun to learn**. Let the geeky
part of you enjoy it!
