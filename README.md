# GitHub Tutorial

## An introduction to Git and GitHub
This tutorial covers the basics of the Git version control tool in combination
with the popular GitHub web platform.

## Who is this tutorial for?
This tutorial is aimed at graduate students who program in the context of their
research project and struggle with projects that go passed the single script
barrier.

## What problems are we trying to solve?
- Tracking changes and versions in code and documents
- Collaborating with others to do your analyses
- Increasing your online visibility
- Developing better coding and analysis practices
- Sharing your code

Git and GitHub can help you accomplish the above. However, **they will require
some work** to get you started, but **it should also fun to learn**. Let the
geeky part of you enjoy this. You don't have to be a biologist / chemist /
microbiologist... all the time!. :)

  - We will use the command line to understand the process
  - This will be more difficult on Windows
  - You can use a Graphical Interface in the future
- Setup

### Basic Workflow
- Creating a new project
  - Create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com))
  - Include a README file
- Downloading a repository from GitHub
  - Clicking the `Download ZIP` link
  - `git clone`
- Git basic workflow
  - Making some changes (adding and editing files)
  - See what files have changed: `git status`
  - Visualize the changes: `git diff`
  - Choose files to commit `git add`
  - Commit changes `git commit -m "Message"`
  - Send commit to GitHub `git push`
- Using markdown in your README.md
- Differences among files and versions

### More advanced notions
- Creating and pushing tags
- Working with branches
- Forking and pull requests
- Cherry picking
- Reseting
- Creating aliases for common git commands
