## An introduction to Git and GitHub
This tutorial covers the basics of the Git version control tool in combination with the popular GitHub web platform. It should be useful to anyone desiring to learn about Git and GitHub but is specifically aimed at students and academics who program in the context of their research and want to learn more about social coding.

## Why learn Git and GitHub?
By doing so, you should improve at:

- Increasing your online visibility
- Working on your code from anywhere
- Collaborating with other researchers
- Improving coding and analysis practices
- Structuring your code and projects better
- Sharing your code and embracing Open Science
- Creating basic web pages to show your analyses
- Creating easy documentation and tutorials
- Showing that your projects are alive
- Tracking code changes and versions
- Promoting your career

Git and GitHub can help you accomplish the above. However, **they require some
work** to get you started, but **it can also be fun to learn**. Let the geeky
part of you enjoy this. You don't have to be a scientist all the time!
